# Control Structures in Python

This repository contains two simple Python programs that demonstrate the use of conditional statements and loops in Python.

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
**File:** `task1_even_odd.py`

### Problem Statement:
- Takes an integer input from the user.
- Checks whether the number is **even** or **odd** using an if-else statement.
- Displays the result accordingly.

### Expected Output:
```

Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number.

Enter a number: 12
12 is an even number.

```

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
**File:** `task2_sum_1_to_50.py`

### Problem Statement:
- Uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from **1 to 50**.
- Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
- Displays the final sum.

### Expected Output:
```

The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
